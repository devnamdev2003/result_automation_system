Struts is an open-source framework for developing web applications in Java. It provides a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and is designed to simplify the development of enterprise-level Java web applications. Struts was originally created by Craig McClanahan and donated to the Apache Software Foundation.

### Key Features and Components of Struts:

1. **MVC Architecture:**
   - Struts follows the MVC pattern, separating an application into three main components: Model (business logic), View (user interface), and Controller (request processing).

2. **ActionServlet:**
   - The core controller component in Struts is the ActionServlet, responsible for managing the flow of control within the application. It receives HTTP requests, invokes the appropriate Action class, and forwards the request to the appropriate view.

3. **Action Classes:**
   - Action classes in Struts are Java classes that encapsulate the application's business logic. They handle specific user requests and interact with the Model to process data.

4. **Form Beans:**
   - Form beans are Java objects that encapsulate the data submitted by users through HTML forms. They provide a way to organize and validate user input.

5. **Struts Configuration File (struts-config.xml):**
   - Configuration in Struts is defined in an XML file (struts-config.xml). This file specifies the mapping between URLs, Action classes, and views. It also defines the flow of control within the application.

6. **Tag Libraries:**
   - Struts provides custom tag libraries (such as HTML tags) to simplify the creation of user interface components in JSP pages. These tags generate HTML and handle interactions with the underlying Struts framework.

7. **Validator Framework:**
   - Struts includes a built-in validation framework that allows developers to define and enforce validation rules for form data. This helps ensure that the data submitted by users is accurate and meets specified criteria.

8. **Tiles Framework:**
   - The Tiles framework in Struts allows developers to create reusable and modular layouts for web pages. It simplifies the management of consistent page layouts across an application.

### Typical Workflow in a Struts Application:

1. **User Sends Request:**
   - The user interacts with the web application by sending an HTTP request, typically by submitting an HTML form or clicking on a link.

2. **ActionServlet Receives Request:**
   - The ActionServlet receives the incoming request and determines the corresponding Action class based on the configuration defined in struts-config.xml.

3. **Action Class Processes Request:**
   - The Action class processes the request, interacts with the Model to perform business logic, and stores the results in the request, session, or application scope.

4. **Forward to View:**
   - The Action class forwards the request to a specific view, typically a JSP page, by specifying the view's name in the struts-config.xml file.

5. **View Renders Response:**
   - The view (JSP page) receives the data from the Action class and renders the HTML response that is sent back to the user's browser.

### Advantages of Struts:

1. **MVC Separation:**
   - Struts enforces a clear separation of concerns with its MVC architecture, making it easier to manage and maintain large-scale applications.

2. **Reusable Components:**
   - Components like Action classes, form beans, and custom tags promote code reusability and modularity.

3. **Validation Framework:**
   - The built-in validation framework helps ensure data integrity and reduces the likelihood of processing incorrect or malicious input.

4. **Integration with Other Technologies:**
   - Struts can be easily integrated with other Java technologies and frameworks, such as JavaServer Faces (JSF), Hibernate, and Spring.

5. **Active Community and Support:**
   - Being an open-source project under the Apache Software Foundation, Struts has a vibrant community, active development, and good documentation.

### Disadvantages of Struts:

1. **Learning Curve:**
   - Struts has a steeper learning curve for beginners, particularly those new to the MVC architecture and XML configuration.

2. **XML Configuration:**
   - The extensive use of XML for configuration can be seen as a disadvantage for those who prefer annotation-based or programmatic configuration.

3. **Limited AJAX Support:**
   - Struts 1.x, the earlier version, has limited support for AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) compared to more modern web frameworks.

4. **Complexity for Small Projects:**
   - Struts might be considered overkill for small projects or applications where a simpler framework could be more appropriate.

While Struts has been widely used in the past, the web development landscape has evolved, and developers may now explore more modern alternatives such as Spring MVC, Apache Struts 2, or other Java web frameworks based on their specific project requirements and preferences.

Hibernate is a popular open-source framework for object-relational mapping (ORM) in Java. It simplifies the development of database-driven applications by providing a higher-level, object-oriented programming model for interacting with relational databases. Hibernate is widely used in Java enterprise applications to handle database operations and manage the persistence of Java objects.

### Key Features and Concepts of Hibernate:

1. **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):**
   - Hibernate facilitates the mapping of Java objects to database tables and vice versa. This eliminates the need for developers to write low-level SQL queries manually.

2. **Hibernate Configuration:**
   - Hibernate is configured through XML or annotations, specifying details such as database connection properties, mapping information, and other settings.

3. **Mapping Entities:**
   - Entities in Hibernate represent Java objects that are persisted to a database. These entities are mapped to database tables, and their attributes correspond to columns in those tables.

4. **Annotations:**
   - Hibernate supports the use of annotations to define mappings, reducing the reliance on XML configuration. Annotations are often used to specify relationships, primary keys, and other mapping details directly within the Java classes.

5. **Hibernate Query Language (HQL):**
   - HQL is a powerful query language provided by Hibernate. It allows developers to express database queries in terms of their Java objects rather than SQL. HQL is similar to SQL but operates on entity objects.

6. **Criteria API:**
   - The Criteria API in Hibernate provides a programmatic and type-safe way to express queries using a set of criteria objects. It is an alternative to HQL and allows for dynamic query construction.

7. **Lazy Loading:**
   - Hibernate supports lazy loading, a technique where the data associated with a particular entity is loaded only when it is explicitly requested. This helps optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary database queries.

8. **Caching:**
   - Hibernate includes caching mechanisms to improve performance. It supports first-level caching (session-level) and second-level caching (application-level or across sessions) to reduce the number of database queries.

9. **Transaction Management:**
   - Hibernate integrates with Java Transaction API (JTA) and allows for the management of transactions. It provides mechanisms for handling transactions programmatically or through declarative transaction demarcation.

10. **Integration with Spring and Java EE:**
    - Hibernate can be seamlessly integrated with the Spring framework and Java EE applications. This integration simplifies the development of enterprise applications by combining the capabilities of Hibernate with those of the respective frameworks.

11. **Automatic Table Generation:**
    - Hibernate can automatically generate database tables based on the entity mappings, eliminating the need for developers to create tables manually.

### Typical Workflow with Hibernate:

1. **Entity Class Creation:**
   - Define Java entity classes representing the business objects to be persisted.

2. **Mapping Configuration:**
   - Configure the mapping between entity classes and database tables using XML configuration or annotations.

3. **SessionFactory Creation:**
   - Create a Hibernate SessionFactory, which is a heavyweight object that is typically created once during application startup.

4. **Session Acquisition:**
   - Obtain a Hibernate Session from the SessionFactory. A Session represents a single unit of work and is used to perform database operations.

5. **Data Persistence:**
   - Use the Session to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on entity objects. Changes made to objects within a session are automatically synchronized with the database.

6. **Querying Data:**
   - Use HQL, the Criteria API, or native SQL queries to retrieve data from the database.

7. **Transaction Management:**
   - Manage transactions using the Hibernate transaction management capabilities. Transactions help ensure data consistency and integrity.

8. **Closing Resources:**
   - Close the Session and SessionFactory when they are no longer needed to release resources.

### Advantages of Hibernate:

1. **Simplified Data Access:**
   - Hibernate abstracts away the complexities of JDBC and provides a higher-level, object-oriented API for interacting with databases.

2. **Portability:**
   - Hibernate is database-agnostic, meaning that the same code can be used with different databases without major modifications.

3. **Productivity:**
   - Developers can focus on business logic rather than dealing with low-level database operations, leading to increased productivity.

4. **Object-Oriented Paradigm:**
   - Hibernate allows developers to work with Java objects directly, making it easier to represent and manipulate data in an object-oriented manner.

5. **Automatic Table Generation:**
   - Hibernate can automatically generate database tables based on the entity mappings, reducing the manual effort required for database setup.

6. **Caching:**
   - Caching mechanisms in Hibernate help improve application performance by reducing the need for repeated database queries.

### Disadvantages of Hibernate:

1. **Learning Curve:**
   - There is a learning curve associated with Hibernate, especially for beginners. Understanding the configuration options, mappings, and query languages can take time.

2. **Performance Overhead:**
   - In certain scenarios, Hibernate's abstraction layer may introduce

 some performance overhead compared to optimized native SQL queries.

3. **Complex Configuration:**
   - Configuration in Hibernate, especially XML configuration, can become complex as the application scales.

4. **Limited Control for Database-Specific Optimizations:**
   - Hibernate abstracts away database-specific details, limiting the developer's ability to fine-tune optimizations for a specific database.

5. **Not Suitable for All Scenarios:**
   - While Hibernate is suitable for many scenarios, it may not be the best choice for performance-critical applications where direct SQL optimization is crucial.

Overall, Hibernate is a powerful and widely adopted framework for simplifying database access in Java applications, particularly in the context of object-relational mapping. Its strengths lie in its ability to handle the persistence layer efficiently and provide a robust set of features for data access.

JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a technology used for building dynamic web pages in Java. It allows developers to embed Java code within HTML pages, enabling the creation of dynamic content that can interact with Java objects, databases, and other resources. JSP is part of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) and is commonly used for developing web applications.

### Key Concepts and Features of JSP:

1. **Embedded Java Code:**
   - JSP allows developers to embed Java code directly into HTML pages using special tags. This code is processed on the server side before the page is sent to the client's browser.

   ```jsp
   <%  // Java code here %>
   ```

2. **JSP Tags:**
   - JSP tags are special elements enclosed in `<% %>` that provide functionality beyond simple Java code. There are several types of tags in JSP, including directive tags, declaration tags, scriptlet tags, expression tags, and custom tags.

   ```jsp
   <%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" %>
   <jsp:declaration>
      int variable = 5;
   </jsp:declaration>
   <jsp:scriptlet>
      out.println("Hello, JSP!");
   </jsp:scriptlet>
   <jsp:expression>
      <%= variable %>
   </jsp:expression>
   ```

3. **Directives:**
   - Directives are used to provide global information about the entire JSP page. Common directives include setting the page's language, defining character encoding, and importing Java classes.

   ```jsp
   <%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" %>
   ```

4. **Declaration Tags:**
   - Declaration tags are used to declare variables and methods that can be used later in the JSP page.

   ```jsp
   <jsp:declaration>
      int variable = 5;
      void myMethod() {
         // method implementation
      }
   </jsp:declaration>
   ```

5. **Scriptlet Tags:**
   - Scriptlet tags contain Java code that is executed each time the page is requested. They are used to perform dynamic logic and generate dynamic content.

   ```jsp
   <jsp:scriptlet>
      out.println("Hello, JSP!");
   </jsp:scriptlet>
   ```

6. **Expression Tags:**
   - Expression tags are used to embed the result of a Java expression directly into the HTML content.

   ```jsp
   <jsp:expression>
      <%= variable %>
   </jsp:expression>
   ```

7. **Implicit Objects:**
   - JSP provides a set of implicit objects that are automatically available in every JSP page. These objects include request, response, session, application, out (for writing output), and others.

   ```jsp
   <%= request.getParameter("parameterName") %>
   ```

8. **Tag Libraries (Custom Tags):**
   - JSP allows the creation and use of custom tags, which are extensions to the basic JSP syntax. Tag libraries can encapsulate complex functionality and make it more readable and maintainable.

   ```jsp
   <c:forEach var="item" items="${items}">
      ${item}
   </c:forEach>
   ```

9. **Expression Language (EL):**
   - Expression Language is a simplified way to access data stored in JavaBeans components within JSP pages. It provides a concise syntax for accessing properties, arrays, lists, and maps.

   ```jsp
   ${bean.property}
   ```

### Typical Workflow with JSP:

1. **JSP Page Creation:**
   - Create a JSP page with a `.jsp` extension, combining HTML and embedded Java code as needed.

2. **Java Code and Logic:**
   - Use scriptlet tags `<% %>` to embed Java code for dynamic logic, calculations, or data retrieval.

3. **Tag Libraries:**
   - Utilize tag libraries, such as JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL) or custom tags, to enhance functionality and maintain readability.

4. **Expression Language (EL):**
   - Use EL to access data from JavaBeans components or other sources, simplifying the integration of dynamic data into HTML content.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the JSP pages to a web container or application server, such as Apache Tomcat or WildFly.

6. **Request Processing:**
   - When a client requests the JSP page, the server processes the embedded Java code, executes any dynamic logic, and generates HTML content to be sent back to the client's browser.

### Advantages of JSP:

1. **Simplicity and Familiarity:**
   - JSP combines Java code with HTML, making it familiar to developers with a background in web development and Java.

2. **Reusability:**
   - Java code and components can be reused in multiple JSP pages, promoting code reusability.

3. **Integration with Java EE:**
   - JSP seamlessly integrates with other Java EE technologies and frameworks, allowing the development of robust and scalable web applications.

4. **Dynamic Content Generation:**
   - JSP enables the generation of dynamic content by embedding Java code within HTML, making it well-suited for building dynamic web applications.

5. **Tag Libraries and EL:**
   - The use of tag libraries and Expression Language simplifies complex logic and enhances the readability of JSP pages.

### Disadvantages of JSP:

1. **Mixing of Concerns:**
   - The mixing of Java code and HTML in JSP can lead to the entanglement of business logic with presentation, making it harder to maintain and test.

2. **Limited Separation of Concerns:**
   - While JSP provides some separation of concerns, it may not offer the same level of clarity and modularity as modern front-end frameworks and templating engines.

3. **Complexity with Large Applications:**
   - For large and complex applications, the use of JSP alone may lead to spaghetti code and reduced maintainability.

4. **Performance Concerns:**
   - JSP pages are compiled into servlets, and the initial compilation process might introduce some latency during the first request. However, subsequent requests benefit from cached servlet

s.

5. **Modern Alternatives:**
   - With the advent of more modern front-end frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) and server-side technologies (e.g., Spring Boot), developers may opt for alternatives that provide better separation of concerns and improved development workflows.

Servlets are Java-based components that run on the server-side of a web application to handle requests and generate dynamic responses. They are part of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE), and play a crucial role in building dynamic, server-side web applications. Servlets provide a way to extend the capabilities of web servers and respond to client requests, typically for generating dynamic content, handling form submissions, and managing session data.

### Key Concepts and Features of Servlets:

1. **Lifecycle:**
   - Servlets have a well-defined lifecycle consisting of three main phases: initialization, service, and destruction. The servlet container (such as Tomcat or Jetty) manages the lifecycle of servlets.

2. **Request Handling:**
   - Servlets handle incoming HTTP requests by implementing the `doGet` or `doPost` methods. These methods process the request, perform necessary operations, and generate a response that is sent back to the client.

   ```java
   protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
       // Servlet logic for handling GET requests
   }
   ```

3. **HTTP Methods:**
   - Servlets can handle various HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. The specific method to be handled is determined by the corresponding method in the servlet class (`doGet`, `doPost`, etc.).

4. **Request and Response Objects:**
   - Servlets interact with clients through the `HttpServletRequest` and `HttpServletResponse` objects. The request object provides information about the client's request, while the response object is used to send data back to the client.

5. **Session Management:**
   - Servlets can manage user sessions by using the `HttpSession` object. Sessions allow the server to store user-specific data across multiple requests, enabling features like user authentication and personalized content.

   ```java
   HttpSession session = request.getSession();
   session.setAttribute("username", "john_doe");
   ```

6. **Initialization Parameters:**
   - Servlets can be configured with initialization parameters in the deployment descriptor (`web.xml`). These parameters can be accessed during the servlet's initialization phase.

   ```xml
   <servlet>
       <servlet-name>MyServlet</servlet-name>
       <servlet-class>com.example.MyServlet</servlet-class>
       <init-param>
           <param-name>paramName</param-name>
           <param-value>paramValue</param-value>
       </init-param>
   </servlet>
   ```

7. **URL Mapping:**
   - Servlets are mapped to specific URLs using the deployment descriptor or annotations. This mapping determines which servlet should handle requests for a particular URL pattern.

   ```xml
   <servlet-mapping>
       <servlet-name>MyServlet</servlet-name>
       <url-pattern>/myservlet</url-pattern>
   </servlet-mapping>
   ```

8. **Thread Safety:**
   - Servlets are inherently multithreaded. Each request to a servlet is typically handled by a separate thread. It is important to ensure thread safety, especially when dealing with shared resources or data.

9. **Filtering:**
   - Servlets can be used in conjunction with filters to perform pre-processing or post-processing of requests and responses. Filters can modify request or response data before it reaches the servlet or before it is sent back to the client.

10. **Exception Handling:**
    - Servlets can handle exceptions using the `try-catch` mechanism. Custom error pages can also be configured in the deployment descriptor to provide a more user-friendly error message.

   ```java
   try {
       // Servlet logic
   } catch (Exception e) {
       // Exception handling
   }
   ```

### Typical Workflow with Servlets:

1. **Servlet Class Creation:**
   - Create a Java class that extends the `HttpServlet` class or implements the `Servlet` interface. Override the appropriate methods such as `doGet` or `doPost` to handle specific HTTP methods.

2. **Logic Implementation:**
   - Implement the servlet logic within the overridden methods. Access request parameters, process data, interact with databases, or perform any necessary operations.

3. **Deployment Descriptor:**
   - Configure the servlet in the deployment descriptor (`web.xml`) or use annotations for servlet mapping and initialization parameters.

4. **Session Management (Optional):**
   - If session management is required, use the `HttpSession` object to store and retrieve session attributes.

5. **Request Handling:**
   - The servlet container (e.g., Tomcat) handles incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate servlet based on the URL mapping.

6. **Response Generation:**
   - Generate dynamic content by writing to the `HttpServletResponse` object. This content is sent back to the client as the response.

7. **URL Mapping:**
   - Configure URL mappings to associate specific URLs with the servlet in the deployment descriptor or using annotations.

8. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the web application, including servlets, to a servlet container or application server.

### Advantages of Servlets:

1. **Platform Independence:**
   - Servlets are written in Java, making them platform-independent and capable of running on any system with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

2. **Performance:**
   - Servlets are efficient in handling multiple requests concurrently, making them suitable for building scalable web applications.

3. **Integration with Java EE:**
   - Servlets seamlessly integrate with other Java EE technologies, such as JavaServer Pages (JSP), Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), and more.

4. **Session Management:**
   - Servlets provide built-in support for session management, enabling the creation and management of user sessions.

5. **Flexibility:**
   - Servlets can handle various types of requests (GET, POST, etc.) and can generate a wide range of responses, including HTML, XML, JSON, and more.

6. **Rich Ecosystem:**
   - Servlets are part of a rich ecosystem of Java EE technologies and frameworks, allowing developers to build comprehensive and feature-rich web applications.

### Disadvantages of Servlets:

1. **Complexity:**
   - Writing servlets involves managing the HTTP protocol, handling requests and responses, and manually managing session state, which can be complex.

2. **Mixing Business Logic with Presentation:**
   - Servlets often mix business logic with presentation, leading to code that may be less modular and harder to maintain.

3. **Limited Support for Front-End Technologies:**
   - Servlets focus on server-side processing and lack built-in support for modern front-end technologies. Developers often use Servlets in conjunction with JSP or other frameworks for a complete solution.

4. **Cumbersome HTML Generation:**
   - Servlets generate HTML content by concatenating strings, which can lead to cumbersome and error-prone HTML code generation.

5. **Verbosity:**
   - Servlet code can become verbose, especially when dealing with low-level details such as input/output streams and response headers.

While servlets are a foundational technology for server-side Java web development, modern web applications often leverage higher-level frameworks and technologies to enhance productivity and maintainability. Servlets are frequently used in conjunction with JavaServer Pages (JSP), frameworks like Spring MVC, or other Java-based web frameworks to address some of their limitations.

Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) is a component architecture for building scalable and distributed enterprise-level applications in Java. EJB is part of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE), which is now known as Jakarta EE. EJB components are server-side components that encapsulate the business logic of an application and provide services such as transaction management, security, and persistence. EJB components are managed by an EJB container, which is part of the Java EE application server.

### Key Concepts and Features of EJB:

1. **Session Beans:**
   - Session beans represent business logic and are used to perform specific operations for clients. There are two types of session beans: stateful and stateless. Stateful session beans maintain conversational state with a specific client, while stateless session beans do not retain state between method invocations.

2. **Entity Beans (Deprecated):**
   - In older versions of EJB (EJB 2.x), entity beans were used to represent persistent data entities. However, entity beans were complex to work with, and EJB 3.x introduced a simpler and more flexible approach to persistence using Java Persistence API (JPA). In modern EJB development, JPA is the preferred choice for dealing with database entities.

3. **Message-Driven Beans:**
   - Message-driven beans are used to process messages asynchronously. They are often employed in message-driven architectures using Java Message Service (JMS) to enable communication between components in a loosely coupled manner.

4. **Container-Managed Transactions:**
   - EJB provides declarative transaction management, where developers can define transactional behavior using annotations or XML configuration. The container automatically manages the beginning, commit, and rollback of transactions, ensuring data integrity.

   ```java
   @TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRED)
   public void performTransactionalOperation() {
       // Business logic with transactional requirements
   }
   ```

5. **Security:**
   - EJB supports declarative security, allowing developers to specify access control rules for methods using annotations or deployment descriptors. This helps in securing sensitive operations and data.

   ```java
   @RolesAllowed("admin")
   public void performAdminOperation() {
       // Business logic accessible only to users with "admin" role
   }
   ```

6. **Dependency Injection:**
   - EJB components can use dependency injection to obtain references to other components, resources, or services. This simplifies the development and enhances modularity.

   ```java
   @EJB
   private SomeOtherBean otherBean;
   ```

7. **Asynchronous Method Invocation:**
   - EJB supports asynchronous method invocation, allowing methods to be executed asynchronously, which is useful for long-running or background tasks.

   ```java
   @Asynchronous
   public void performAsynchronousOperation() {
       // Asynchronous business logic
   }
   ```

8. **Interceptors:**
   - EJB interceptors enable the implementation of cross-cutting concerns such as logging, performance monitoring, and validation. Interceptors can be applied to individual methods or to the entire class.

   ```java
   @Interceptors(LoggingInterceptor.class)
   public void performLoggedOperation() {
       // Business logic with logging
   }
   ```

### Development Workflow with EJB:

1. **EJB Component Creation:**
   - Create EJB components (session beans, message-driven beans) using annotations or deployment descriptors. Define business logic, transactional behavior, and security requirements.

2. **Dependency Injection:**
   - Use dependency injection to obtain references to other EJB components, resources, or services required by the business logic.

3. **Transaction Management:**
   - Declare transactional behavior for methods using annotations. Specify whether a method requires a new transaction, supports an existing transaction, or does not participate in transactions.

4. **Security Configuration:**
   - Define security roles and access control rules using annotations or deployment descriptors. Specify which roles are allowed to access specific methods.

5. **Asynchronous Methods (Optional):**
   - If needed, mark methods as asynchronous to enable their execution in a separate thread, allowing for improved scalability.

6. **Interceptors (Optional):**
   - Use interceptors to implement cross-cutting concerns such as logging, auditing, or performance monitoring.

7. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests for EJB components using testing frameworks such as JUnit. Mock external dependencies when necessary.

8. **Deployment:**
   - Package the EJB components into an Enterprise Archive (EAR) file and deploy it to a Java EE-compliant application server.

9. **Integration with Other Java EE Components:**
   - Integrate EJB components with other Java EE components, such as servlets, JavaServer Pages (JSP), or other frameworks, to build comprehensive web applications.

### Advantages of EJB:

1. **Scalability:**
   - EJB components can be distributed across multiple servers, enabling scalable and load-balanced enterprise applications.

2. **Transaction Management:**
   - EJB provides declarative transaction management, simplifying the development of transactional applications and ensuring data consistency.

3. **Security:**
   - Declarative security in EJB allows developers to define access control rules, securing the application against unauthorized access.

4. **Component Reusability:**
   - EJB promotes the development of modular and reusable components, enhancing maintainability and reducing code duplication.

5. **Asynchronous Processing:**
   - EJB supports asynchronous method invocation, allowing for the efficient processing of background tasks or long-running operations.

6. **Interceptors:**
   - Interceptors enable the implementation of cross-cutting concerns without cluttering the business logic, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

### Disadvantages of EJB:

1. **Complexity (Historically):**
   - In earlier versions (EJB 2.x), EJB was criticized for being complex and difficult to work with. However, EJB 3.x introduced significant simplifications and improvements.

2. **Learning Curve:**
   - There can be a learning curve associated with EJB, especially for developers who are new to enterprise-level Java development.

3. **Overhead:**
   - EJB components, when compared to lightweight alternatives like Spring beans, may have more runtime overhead due to the services provided by the EJB container.

4. **Limited Front-End Integration:**
   - EJB is primarily focused on server-side business logic. For web applications, developers often use EJB in conjunction with servlets, JSP, or other front-end frameworks.

5. **Legacy Considerations:**
   - In modern Java EE (now Jakarta EE) development, some consider EJB as a legacy technology, and developers may choose alternative frameworks like Spring for newer projects. However, EJB continues to be supported and used in many enterprise applications.
